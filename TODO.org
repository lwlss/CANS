* TODO [0/7]
  - [ ] Fix negative cells problem
    - First fix with an equality caused odeint to crash
    - Could just fix this in the data after running and at the start
      of the function.
  - [ ] params and neighourhood scope
    - Do I need to pass these each time or can I return a fn inside
      another fn like Conor
  - [ ] Think about the location of functions
    - Would some of them be better in a module?
  - [ ] Make an array of subplots
  - [ ] Write unittests
  - [ ] Compare timings with Conors code
  - [ ] Consider Julia
