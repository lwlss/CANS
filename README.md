### Competition-based model of growth of cell populations on solid agar surfaces

During Quantiatitive Fitness Analysis ([QFA](http://research.ncl.ac.uk/qfa/)) of microbial cultures, we analyse the way cultures grow on solid agar surfaces.  Basically, we inoculate cells onto an agar surface, and repeatedly photograph the agar plates as the populations grow, analysing images (using the [Colonyzer](http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer/) software) to estimate changes in cell density over time.  Usually we assume that cultures grow independently, and this is a good assumption during the early part of the growth phase.  However, later in the growth phase, it seems likely that competition between cultures will become important.  This model attempts to account for that competition.
