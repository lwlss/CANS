* TODO [0/1]
  - At the moment b and a do not fit very well. The fit appears to
    improve if observation time is longer.
  - As expected kn and ks do not change from initial values in a
    single culture simulation.
  - I anticipate that we may need to remove early values from the data
    if actual values fall below the resolution to detect cells. This
    would mean taking of any values below a certain IOD which can be
    discovered by looking at an exponential fit on a logarithmic
    scale.
  - It is important that we are able to recover diffusion constants
    well.
  - [ ] Compare true plots to estimated plots.
