* TODO [4/7]
  - At the moment b and a do not fit very well. The fit appears to
    improve if observation time is longer.
  - As expected kn and ks do not change from initial values in a
    single culture simulation.
  - I anticipate that we may need to remove early values from the data
    if actual values fall below the resolution to detect cells. This
    would mean taking of any values below a certain IOD which can be
    discovered by looking at an exponential fit on a logarithmic
    scale.
  - It is important that we are able to recover diffusion constants
    well as we are modelling competition. However might be a many
    possible solutions with different alpha beta and initail amounts.
  - [X] Compare true plots to estimated plots.
  - Times solved by odeint are slightly different to the observed
    times.
  - Should perhaps fix beta - the effect of signal on cells.
  - Could also fix or at least constrain alpha - the rate of
    secretion of signal.
  - Might be better to compare signal only diffusion and nutrient
    diffusion only models.
  - [X] Try model C + N -> 2C + S
  - [X] Find way to store model tuple as an attribute/string so that
    it can easily be changed. THIS WAS SLOW.
  - [X] Make fitting general to n x m plate.
  - [ ] Look at code design
    - Either make fitting methods or go functional.
  - [ ] Plot cans_true, cans_fit_of_cans, and inde_fit_of_cans on same
    axes.
  - [ ] Also plot inde_true, cans_fit_of_inde, inde_fit_of_inde on
    same axes.
