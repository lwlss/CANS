* TODO [1/3]
  - [X] Code should be able to handle empty spots
    - e.g. in miniQFA
    - [X] Is it better to bound rs to be zero (0, 0) or remove them as
      parameters?
      - First approach is easier to implement but I am slighly uneasy
        with passing fixed parameters to the optimizer.
	- I went with bounds. This approach requires you to set c_meas
          as zeros for empty spots.
    - [X] Do no plot C for empty plates.
  - [ ] Determine stopping criteria for fits
    - [ ] Time fitting
    - [ ] What value of ftol to use? Or use fun? What value?
  - [ ] Run full plate fits in parallel using different initial
    guesses.
    - Should these be read from file or randomly generated each time?
    - If read from file would have to apply
