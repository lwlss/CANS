* TODO [1/8]
  - [X] Code should be able to handle empty spots
    - e.g. in miniQFA
    - [X] Is it better to bound rs to be zero (0, 0) or remove them as
      parameters?
      - First approach is easier to implement but I am slighly uneasy
        with passing fixed parameters to the optimizer.
	- I went with bounds. This approach requires you to set c_meas
          as zeros for empty spots.
    - [X] Do no plot C for empty plates.
  - [ ] Determine stopping criteria for fits
    - Can do this in a loop.
    - [ ] Time fitting
    - [ ] What value of ftol to use?
  - [ ] Run full plate fits in parallel using different initial
    guesses.
    - [ ] Do so for several kns
    - [ ] 10 x random
    - [ ] Uniform
    - [ ] Inde est
    - These should be saved and read from file.
  - [ ] Determine how to store results
  - [ ] Determine how to parse in data
    - Only want meta data in one place if possible? So a reference to
      the data set should be fine.
  - [ ] Fit a 6x6 square of true data and remove outside squares.
  - [ ] Is it faster to go cultures->inde->comp or cultures->comp?
  - [ ] Are comp estimates more reliable than logistic or single
    culture allowing N_0 to vary?
