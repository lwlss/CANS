It seems possible that we can use a gradient method in the plate level
candidate evaluator, provided we use imaginary neighbour guessing and
evolve b guess. I need to check the previous best fits and see if they
have a consistent N_0/NE_0 which I can use. I will try to get the
plate level genetic algorithm working for a 3x3 plate. It only
probably requires imag neigh guessing for larger plates but I should
get this working anyway. Could comment it out.
