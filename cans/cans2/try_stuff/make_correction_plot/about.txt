1) Find the best fit to p15 X

2) Simulate cell/nutrient amounts and save these for one culture (9, 2). X

3) Save the cell measurements X

4) Take and save comp model estimated b, N_0 and C_0 X

5) Simulate corrected cell amounts using these parameters with kn = 0 / for 1x1.

6) Put on the same plot (maybe include nutrients/maybe not)

5) Fit the logistic model to the cell measurements in a different plot. X
