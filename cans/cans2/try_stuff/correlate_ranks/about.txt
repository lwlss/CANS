Plot rank correlations between different estimates.

Use the two best CompModel and CompModelBC estimates and the logistic model guess. The logistic model guess will have used a fixed rather than fitted C_0. Check that the b estimates are either all the same or simulate and find the smallest objective function. I don't think that I have been storing the objective functions of guesses up to now. The fits are indiviudal so we will have to sum. I don't know whether I have saved the estimated N_0 (individually) either so will probably have to rerun these guesses.

The logistic equivalent model r and K estimates are not good for slow growing cultures so I need to implement hueristic checks such as those in the QFA R package. For now I will just use MDR*MDP from the QFA R package. See correlate_ranks_QFA_R.py.
