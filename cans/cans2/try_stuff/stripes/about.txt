Empty cultures on the plate are identifieable by the gene name
"EMPTY".

If we do not remove cell observations for these cultures from the
objective function it will bias our estimate of C_0 (a plate level
parameter), due to background noise. It is not enough to just set b=0.

How to do this?

For the guesser we can just skip empty cultures and set b=0. The guess
of N_0 isn't as important but should probably be based on only the
final cell amounts of the growing cultures.

No changes are required for the sbml. We still need to solve cells for
empty cultures and we can bound b to be zero.

We must remove cell measurements from the objective function
evaluation. To do this make a c_meas_obj to use in objective function
evaluations and use c_meas for plots etc. Then slice the result of the
solver to remove the empties in the objective function. Did the mask
do this before?
