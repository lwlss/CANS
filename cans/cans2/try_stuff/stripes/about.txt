Empty cultures on the plate are identifieable by the gene name
"EMPTY".

If we do not remove cell observations for these cultures from the
objective function it will bias our estimate of C_0 (a plate level
parameter), due to background noise. It is not enough to just set b=0.

How to do this?

For the guesser we can just skip empty cultures and set b=0. The guess
of N_0 isn't as important but should probably be based on only the
final cell amounts of the growing cultures.

No changes are required for the sbml. We still need to solve cells for
empty cultures and we can bound b to be zero.

We must remove cell measurements from the objective function
evaluation. To do this make a c_meas_obj to use in objective function
evaluations and use c_meas for plots etc. Then slice the result of the
solver to remove the empties in the objective function.

There are 49 timepoints in the stripes data. There were only 10 for
p15. As a result, simulating between timepoints is much slower. We are
also having to slice simulated amounts for only the growers (i.e. to
remove the empties). This is already likely to be slower, but with
many timepoints the arrays become much larger. Fits were taking a long
time, especially for the plate with empties; supporting the idea that
for growers is slower. To speed things up I am using a 5th power
spline of c_meas to get c_spline, evenly spaced cell measurements. I
am doing this for 15 timepoints. Having even steps now allows us to
call rr.simulate once, rather for every timestep, and is also likely
to be quicker.
