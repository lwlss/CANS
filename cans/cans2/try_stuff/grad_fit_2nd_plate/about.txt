QUALITATIVE validation with a 2nd plate.

I want to fit a 2nd plate as validation. Previously I fit p15 and,
although it did not find a global minimum, it did at least fit the
data qualitatively. Rank order of b was also highly correlated between
the best fits (different local minima) and we could compare this with
a 2nd plate provided it contains repeats.


How?  The code for doing so already exists as a python script and a
bash script to run it. This starts multiple processes that use
different initial guesses. I just need to pass a the file path of the
data to the python script.

REMEMBER to save the correct SBML, with the estimated parameters, not
the guess.
