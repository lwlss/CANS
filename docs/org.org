* TODO Proposal [0/2]
  - [ ] Read refs
  - [ ] Add content from Conors notes
** Aims
  - [ ] What could the results of the project be used for?
    - [ ] To design assays to minimize competition and signalling
      effects
    - [ ] To account for these affects in the analysis of the data
      - [ ] Create a package(s) to do this for future experiments
      - [ ] Reanalyse some existing data
** Objectives

** Background
  - [ ] Explain why we expect competition
  - [ ] What difference to results do we likely expect when modelling
    competition? I.e how large an effect is expected?
  - [ ] Explain benefit of bayesian approach and find counter-example
    from probes
  - [ ] Explain differences/benefits bewteen spot and probe approaches
  - [ ] Example uses of QFA
** Approach
   - Create independent model
     - Test for a small grid
       - Generate a small set of data (growth curves)
       - Analyse to recover growth rates
   - Model competition for nutrients
     - Create a small set of artifical data (perhaps for nine spots at
       first) from the model and analyse this to see how long the
       analysis takes and how well we can recover the underlying
       parameters.
     - We can also write tests for the code at this stage which should
       scale to larger simulations.
     - Extend this to study experimental data.
       - A larger array (384 spots)
       - Reanalyse data
       - Compare with independent model
** Plan
   - This refers to the timescale of different parts of the project
     - Could create a Gantt chart
