* TODO Proposal [1/2]
  - [X] Read refs
  - [ ] Add content from Conors notes
** Aims
  - [ ] HYPOTHESES [0/2]
    - [ ] QFA experiments are affected by competition for nutreints
      and/or signalling.
    - [ ] Reanalysis of telomere(?) data accounting for these effects
      will improve the reliability of predicted interactions and could
      provide evidence of new interactions.
  - [ ] What could the results of the project be used for?
    - [ ] To better understand systematic effects on population growth
      in agar assays.
    - [ ] To design assays to minimize competition and signalling
      effects
    - [ ] To account for these effects in the analysis of the data
      - [ ] Create a package(s) to do this for future experiments
      - [ ] Reanalyse some existing data - Specifically telomere?
	- [ ] The potential applications of QFA are broad and the
          approach could be used to study interactions with any viable
          query gene in bacteria or (what do we call the group of
          single celled eukaryotic organisms for which this is
          appropriate?) in high-throughput or smaller scale manual
          experiments.
** Objectives
  - [ ] Should be bullet point format.
** Background
  - [ ] Explain why we expect competition
  - [ ] What difference to results do we likely expect when modelling
    competition? I.e how large an effect is expected?
  - [ ] Explain benefit of bayesian approach and compare with
    normalization approach in SGA Baryshnikova 2010.
  - [ ] Compare the QFA and SGA approaches
    - [ ] Lower density possible in QFA so we can capture more of the growth
      curve, esp. the initial exponential phase. There is a figure for
      this in
  - [ ] Example uses of QFA
  - [ ] Logistic model
  - [ ] Nutrient diffusion and signalling
    - [ ] Models
    - [ ] Evidence for the types of signalling
      - [ ] ethanol
** Approach
   - Model competition for nutrients
     - Create a small set of artifical data (perhaps for nine spots at
       first) from the model and analyse this to see how long the
       analysis takes and how well we can recover the underlying
       parameters.
     - We can also write tests for the code at this stage which should
       scale to larger simulations.
     - Extend this to study experimental data.
       - A larger array (384 spots)
       - Fit competition model to growth curve data.
       - Compare with independent model (a special case of the
         competition model.)
     - Revise the model if necessary or add signalling factor.
     - Use in a reanalysis of (telomere?) data to discover genetic
       interactions.

** Plan
   - This refers to the timescale of different parts of the project
     - Could create a Gantt chart
