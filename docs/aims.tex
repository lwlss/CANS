\section{Aims}
\label{sec:aims}
Quantitative fitness analysis (QFA) is a method for inferring the
fitness of microbial cultures from their growth curves and can be used
for genome-wide screening of genetic interaction or drug response (see
\citet{Addinall2008,Addinall2011,Lawless2010,Banks2012} (drug
ref)). In QFA, cultures are grown on solid agar plates. When performed
using a high-throughput protocol, growth curves are automatically
captured for mixed arrays of typically 384 (independent genetic
strains)/(cultures). It is possible that growth curves are affected by
competition for nutrients and/or signalling between cultures which is
not accounted for in past analyses of QFA data.

An analysis by \citet{Baryshnikova2010}, of data obtained using
1536-pin synthetic genetic array (SGA), an alternative procedure also
using an array of cultures on solid agar, attempts to normalise for
systematic variation in growth curve observations, which may include
variation from competition and signalling effects, using statistical
techniques aimed at improving the correlation between repeats of
identical mutant strains at different locations. In order to learn
more about the sources of systematic variation in both QFA and SGA
experiments, and to develop analyses and experimental designs for
dealing with them, this project aims to account for competition and
signalling mechanistically. We will study unpublished QFA and SGA data
for the model organism \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}, also studied
by \citet{Addinall2008,Addinall2011} and \citet{Baryshnikova2010}.  We
aim to package all models and analysis tools so that they may be used
in future QFA and SGA studies or to reanalyse data from past
studies. We also aim to determine what effect accounting for
competition and signalling will have on measures of genetic
interaction strength.



\subsection{Hypotheses}
This project aims to determine whether
the following hypotheses are correct:
\begin{itemize}
\item Nutrient and/or signal molecules diffuse through agar at a rate
  sufficient to induce competition between adjacent cultures.
  % Growth of cultures in QFA and SGA experiments is affected by competition for nutrients and/or signalling.
\item By accounting mechanistically for competition effects, it will
  be possible to design analyses and experiments which minimise them.
\item Accounting for competition effects will improve the power to
  infer genetic interactions in genome wide screens.
\end{itemize}
