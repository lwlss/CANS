\label{sec:aims}

The aim of the project is to investigate the following hypotheses relating to (whatever the
general name of the experiments is) assays of mibrobial growth on
solid agar:
\begin{itemize}
\item Growth is not independent and is affected by competition and/or
  signalling.
\item More can be learnt about growth rate by accounting for these
  effects mechanistically (needs explaining).

This may affect the results of existing experiments.
\end{itemize}
