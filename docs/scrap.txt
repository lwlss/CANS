** Not the right place for this and questionable to include it at all.

We will also determine the effect of competition on the different
measures of fitness discussed in section
\ref{sec:genetic-interaction}. In previous studies, which use fits of
the (independent) logistic growth model (refs), fitness estimates
based on carrying capacity \(Z\) might be more affected by competition
and signalling than those based on rate constant \(r\). This is
because gradients in nutrient and signal density will likely be
greater towards the end of growth curves, after the exponential growth
phase, when cultures are larger and have grown for longer.
\\
(To asses
this possibility, we initially attempt to model competition for
nutrients in terms of parameters of the logistic growth model using a
time dependent carrying capacity,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:5}
  Z_{i}(t) = Z_{0,i}\left(\frac{N_{0,i} + \Delta N_{i}(t)}{N_{0,i}}\right),
\end{equation}
where \(Z_{0}\) is the carrying capacity under the assumption of
independence, and is modified by the ratio of net nutrients available
at time \(t\) to the initial amount of nutrients available under the
assumption of independence \(N_{0}\). In this model, the form of rate
constants \(r_{i}\) in \ref{eq:1} is unaltered. Before fitting this
model to data, we would first need to find \(\Delta N_{i}(t)\), the
integral of the second term in \ref{eq:3}b, by fitting a nutrient only
version of \ref{eq:3}. This is just a model, perhaps not a good
one. Another alternative is this model with time dependence removed.

It would take further work to find exact relationships between
parameters of \ref{eq:1} and \ref{eq:3} and to include signalling in
the model.
