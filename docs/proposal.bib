                  of distinct micro-organism cultures on solid agar
                  are useful, rapid methods of quantifying genetic
                  interactions. Growth rate is an informative
                  phenotype which can be estimated by measuring cell
                  densities at one or more times after
                  inoculation. Precise estimates can be made by
                  inoculating cultures onto agar and capturing cell
                  density frequently by plate-scanning or photography,
                  especially throughout the exponential growth phase,
                  and summarising growth with a simple dynamic model
                  (e.g. the logistic growth model). In order to
                  parametrize such a model, a robust image analysis
                  tool capable of capturing a wide range of cell
                  densities from plate photographs is required.},

abstract={This approach relies on colony-size measurements obtained
                  from digital images to determine a composite score
                  derived from both the magnitude and reproducibility
                  of genetic interactions3. The S score is an estimate
                  of the confidence with which genetic interactions
                  can be assigned but does not reflect single- or
                  double-mutant fitness4, which are critical for
                  detailed interpretation of interactions and the
                  resultant network5,6. Furthermore, quantification of
                  colony size measurements using the S score is not as
                  precise as that achieved by higher-accuracy, albeit
                  lower-throughput, methods4. Finally, mapping
                  genome-wide, fitness-based genetic interactions
                  requires normalization of several parameters
                  associated with colony-based interaction assays
                  (Supplementary Table 1), as these can produce
                  unreliable interactions when applied to whole-genome
                  screens.},

abstract = {Quantitative fitness analysis (QFA) is a high throughput
                  experimental and computational methodology for
                  measuring the growth of microbial populations. QFA
                  screens can be used to compare the health of cell
                  populations with and without a mutation in a query
                  gene to infer genetic interaction strengths
                  genomewide, examining thousands of separate
                  genotypes. We introduce Bayesian hierarchical models
                  of population growth rates and genetic interactions
                  that better reflect QFA experimental design than
                  current approaches. Our new approach models
                  population dynamics and genetic interaction
                  simultaneously, thereby avoiding passing information
                  between models via a univariate fitness
                  summary. Matching experimental structure more
                  closely, Bayesian hierarchical approaches use data
                  more efficiently and find new evidence for genes
                  which interact with yeast telomeres within a
                  published data set.},
