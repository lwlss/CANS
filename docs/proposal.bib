abstract = {High-throughput screens comparing growth rates of arrays
                  of distinct micro-organism cultures on solid agar
                  are useful, rapid methods of quantifying genetic
                  interactions. Growth rate is an informative
                  phenotype which can be estimated by measuring cell
                  densities at one or more times after
                  inoculation. Precise estimates can be made by
                  inoculating cultures onto agar and capturing cell
                  density frequently by plate-scanning or photography,
                  especially throughout the exponential growth phase,
                  and summarising growth with a simple dynamic model
                  (e.g. the logistic growth model). In order to
                  parametrize such a model, a robust image analysis
                  tool capable of capturing a wide range of cell
                  densities from plate photographs is required.},
