                  DNA to recruit telomerase and to
                  {\textquotedblleft}cap{\textquotedblright}
                  chromosome ends. In temperature-sensitive cdc13-1
                  mutants telomeric DNA is degraded and cell-cycle
                  progression is inhibited. To identify novel proteins
                  and pathways that cap telomeres, or that respond to
                  uncapped telomeres, we combined cdc13-1 with the
                  yeast gene deletion collection and used
                  high-throughput spot-test assays to measure
                  growth. We identified 369 gene deletions, in eight
                  different phenotypic classes, that reproducibly
                  demonstrated subtle genetic interactions with the
                  cdc13-1 mutation. As expected, we identified DNA
                  damage checkpoint, nonsense-mediated decay and
                  telomerase components in our screen. However, we
                  also identified genes affecting casein kinase II
                  activity, cell polarity, mRNA degradation,
                  mitochondrial function, phosphate transport, iron
                  transport, protein degradation, and other
                  functions. We also identified a number of genes of
                  previously unknown function that we term RTC, for
                  restriction of telomere capping, or MTC, for
                  maintenance of telomere capping. It seems likely
                  that many of the newly identified pathways/processes
                  that affect growth of budding yeast cdc13-1 mutants
                  will play evolutionarily conserved roles at
                  telomeres. The high-throughput spot-testing approach
                  that we describe is generally applicable and could
                  aid in understanding other aspects of eukaryotic
                  cell biology.},

                  specialized structures at the end of linear
                  chromosomes, ensure that chromosome ends are not
                  mistakenly treated as DNA double-strand
                  breaks. Defects in the telomere cap contribute to
                  ageing and cancer. In yeast, defects in telomere
                  capping proteins can cause telomeres to behave like
                  double-strand breaks. To better understand the
                  telomere and responses to capping failure, we have
                  combined a systematic yeast gene deletion library
                  with mutations affecting important yeast telomere
                  capping proteins, Cdc13 or Yku70. Quantitative
                  Fitness Analysis (QFA) was used to accurately
                  measure the fitness of thousands of different yeast
                  strains containing telomere capping defects and
                  additional deletion mutations. Interestingly, we
                  find that many gene deletions suppress one type of
                  telomere capping defect while enhancing
                  another. Through QFA, we can begin to define the
                  roles of different gene products in contributing to
                  different aspects of the telomere cap. Strikingly,
                  mutations in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathways,
                  which degrade many RNA molecules, suppress the
                  <italic>cdc13-1</italic> defect while enhancing the
                  <italic>yku70</italic>? defect. QFA is widely
                  applicable and will be useful for understanding
                  other aspects of yeast cell biology.</p> },

abstract={This approach relies on colony-size measurements obtained
                  from digital images to determine a composite score
                  derived from both the magnitude and reproducibility
                  of genetic interactions3. The S score is an estimate
                  of the confidence with which genetic interactions
                  can be assigned but does not reflect single- or
                  double-mutant fitness4, which are critical for
                  detailed interpretation of interactions and the
                  resultant network5,6. Furthermore, quantification of
                  colony size measurements using the S score is not as
                  precise as that achieved by higher-accuracy, albeit
                  lower-throughput, methods4. Finally, mapping
                  genome-wide, fitness-based genetic interactions
                  requires normalization of several parameters
                  associated with colony-based interaction assays
                  (Supplementary Table 1), as these can produce
                  unreliable interactions when applied to whole-genome
