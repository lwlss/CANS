Implement simple model
1. Write code for simple models of competition and signalling (already have models).
2. Test least squares fitting to artificial data.
3. Fit to real data, evaluate model performance, and assess first hypothesis.


1. Assess effect of competition and signalling on fitness measures.
2. Develop a Bayesian method of inference.

Compare experimental designs
1. Compare competition and signalling effects in different experimental design.
   1. QFA vs SGA
   2. MiniQFA - spatially-discretised two-dimensional model of diffusion.

2. Model development.
   1. Consider alternative models of signalling.
   2. Better models of diffusion - more dimensions, finer grain spatial-discretisation and perhaps continuous.

Finalisation
1. Package, document, and publlish SBML models and python code.
2. Write up.
