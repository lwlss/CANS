\subsection{Inference of Genetic Interactions / Telomere Cap Defects}
(Move to background section.
Motivated by the link between telomere shortening, ageing, and cancer
(refs?), \citet{Addinall2011} study the genetic interactions of
\textit{cdc13} which functions in telomere capping in the model
organism \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}. If the power to predict
genetic interactions is improved in the reanalysis of data from
\citet{Addinall2011}, this may highlight new genes involved in these
processes and will also be relevant for investigations of other types
of genetic interaction and investigations using other types of
microbial organism.)
