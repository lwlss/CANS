\subsection{A Comparison of Methods for Screening Strain Fitness }

QFA and SGA are methods for fitness screening using cultures grown on solid agar, both of
which can be performed using a high-throughput protocol \citet{Baryshnikova2010sga,Banks2012}. SGA
uses pinned cultures of higher initial cell density than the dilute liquid cultures used
in QFA. Although SGA allows for more repeats per plate (1536 cultures vs 384 cultures in
QFA), more of the growth curve can be captured with QFA so fits of growth models are more
accurate (see Figure~\ref{fig:qfa_and_sga_growth_curves}) \citep{Lawless2010}.
Comparison of QFA and SGA cultures in Figure~\ref{fig:qfa_and_sga_growth_curves}c shows
how QFA cultures are composed of many individual colonies which increase in thickness,
whereas SGA cultures are composed of a single uniform colony which grows outwards. The
number of individual colonies in a QFA culture is high enough that lag and other
stochastic effects should average out.

Colonyzer \citep{Lawless2010}, a tool for automatic capture of growth curves from images
of both QFA and SGA plates, uses integrated optical density (IOD) as a proxy for cell
density. Figure~\ref{fig:qfa_curves}, courtesy of \citet{Banks2012}, shows an example of
308 growth curves captured by Colonyzer from a QFA plate. In many SGA studies, culture
area, rather than IOD, is used as a proxy for culture density (example
ref). \cite{Lawless2010} found that direct area measurements are more noisy than IOD
measurements and provide a worse fit to the logistic model. To prevent bias in comparison
of data from QFA and SGA we will use Colonyzer to take the more accurate IOD measurements
for both data types.

Fitness screening can also be performed using liquid cultures which are not susceptible to
competition or signalling effects. However, this approach has lower throughput (ref).

\subsection{Competition and Signalling}

At the beginning of QFA and SGA, nutrients are distributed uniformly throughout the
agar. During incubation, cultures grow, consuming nutrients and creating gradients in
nutrient density. A QFA plate taken partway through incubation can be
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:15_spots}. As some cultures grow much faster than their
neighbours, using more nutrients, we believe that diffusion of nutrients along gradients
between cultures might cause a significant competition effect. Growth of yeast cultures
may also be affected by signal molecules produced by cells, which diffuse through the
agar or travel across its surface. Candidates are ethanol \citep{fujita2006}, a poison
produced by fermentation, and chemicals involved in regulatory response
to changes in cell density (quorum sensing) (see \citet{sprague2006,honigberg2011}).

\subsection{Modelling Approaches}

\subsubsection{Mass Action Kinetics}
Chemical reactions are commonly modelled using mass action kinetics, where the rate of a
reaction in a well stirred mixture is proportional to the product of the concentrations of
the reactants. This reflects the probabilistic nature of reactions, which are dependent on
collisions between reactants. If species numbers are large enough, reactions can be
modelled continuously and deterministicly using ordinary differential equations
(ODEs). Microbial population growth, with cell division dependent on nutrient
availability, can also be modelled using mass action kinetics. We can use the following
reaction equation for a culture growing at location \(i\) on an agar,
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:9}
  \begin{align}
    &N + C \xrightarrow[]{r_{i}} 2C,\\
    &rate = r_{i}[N][C]
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where, \(r_{i}\) is the growth constant, \(C\) is a cell, \(N\) is an amount of nutrients
required for a cell to divide, and [~] are concentrations. In ODE form,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:10}
  \frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = r_{i}N_{i}C_{i}
\end{equation}
where \(C_{i}\) and \(N_{i}\) are the amount of cells and nutrients at location \(i\).
The assumption of a well stirred reaction mixture is perhaps not valid for a culture
growing on agar. However, a mass action approximation has been used with some success to
model predator-prey dynamics of animal populations \citep{Berryman1992} and signalling and
reactions in the spatially heterogeneous environment inside cells
\citep{Aldridge2006,Chen2010} where this assumption is also questionable. If nutrient
gradients within cultures are too large then a PDE model may be required. Reactions that
occur at a surface are better modelled using fractal kinetics \citep{savageau1995}.
\subsubsection{The Logistic Growth Model}
\label{sec:logistic_model}
The logistic growth model,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \dot{x} = rx\left(1 - \frac{x}{K}\right)
\end{equation}
\citep{Verhulst1845}, for a population of density \(x\), with parameters, \(r\), growth
rate and \(K\), carrying capacity, describes self-limiting growth and is commonly used
to fit QFA and SGA data with an assumption of independence between cultures. It has the
following analytical solution:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  x(t) = \frac{KPe^{rt}}{K + P(e^{rt}-1)},
\end{equation}
where P is the initial population density. Measures of fitness are commonly defined in
terms of the parameters \(r\), \(K\), and \(P\). For example, \cite{Addinall2011} define two univariate
fitness measures: the maximum doubling rate (MDR) and maximum doubling potential (MDP) as,
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:3}
    \begin{align}
      MDR &= \frac{r}{log\left(\frac{2(K-P)}{K-2P}\right)},\\
      MDP &= \frac{log\left(\frac{K}{P}\right)}{log(2)}.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Starting from the mass action kinetic model Lawless (``http://cnr.lwlss.net/DSLMassAction/'')
derives an ODE of equivalent form to \ref{eq:1},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:8}
  \frac{dN_{Cell}}{dt} = rN_{Cell}\left(1 - \frac{N_{Cell}}{K}\right),
\end{equation}
where...(maybe don't include this equation explicitly as it could take too much room to
explain and is not essential?) If we can do this for a mass action kinetic model with competition and
signalling, this will allow us to compare the effect of competition and signalling on
existing fitness measures.

\subsection{Fitness Screening in Functional Genomics}
\label{sec:genetic-interaction}
Fitness screening using cultures grown on solid agar has important uses in functional
genomics for inferring genetic interactions and response to environmental conditions and
can be done on a genome wide scale. For example, \citet{Costanzo2010} use SGA data to
construct a genetic interaction map for \textasciitilde 75\% of the \textit{S. cerevisiae}
genome.

There exist several methods for inferring genetic interaction strength from fitness
measures (see \citet{Mani2008}). Fishers multiplicative model of genetic independence
\citep{fisher1919}, used, among others, by \citet{Addinall2011}, states that if two genes,
\textit{a} and \textit{b}, are non-interacting, then the product of the double-mutant and
wild-type fitnesses is equal to the product of the single-mutant fitnesses.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:11}
  [wt][ab] = [a][b],
\end{equation}
where [~] indicates a fitness measure. For fixed wild-type and query genes, \textit{wt} and
\textit{a}, we have the linear relationship,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:12}
  [ab] = k[b]
\end{equation}
where \(k = [a]/[wt]\) is a constant \citep{Addinall2011}. For a mutant \textit{b}
interacting with \textit{a}, if the fitness [ab] falls above the predicted straight line
then the genetic interaction is positive; if it falls below then the interaction is
negative. Using this approach with QFA data from mutants in \textit{Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae}, \citet{Addinall2011} study the genetic interactions of a mutant of
\textit{cdc13}, which functions in telomere capping, in an attempt to discover genes
involved in telomere shortening, which is linked to cancer and ageing. Important
discoveries could be made, leading to health benefits for humans, if the power to predict
genetic interactions is improved by accounting for competition and signalling in
reanalysis of data from such studies. If competition and signalling has an affect in
yeast this is also likely to be relevant for fitness screening using other types of
microbial organisms.
