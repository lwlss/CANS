\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\subsection{Develop an Initial Model}
\label{sec:initial_model}

Figure~\ref{fig:simple_model} shows a schematic of our initial
approach to modelling (nutrient dependent growth with nutrient and
signal diffusion).  Each culture on the agar is given a label, \(i\),
and has three variables associated with it: one observed variable,
\(C_{i}\), the amount of cells in the culture at location \(i\), and
two hidden variables, \(N_{i}\), the amount of nutrients at location
\(i\), and \(S_{i}\), the amount of signal molecule location \(i\).
Cultures in QFA and SGA agars are arranged in a square array, each
culture having eight neighbours with which they could conceivably
interact with directly. Initially, we will model diffusion between
only the four closest neighbours, in the vertical and horizontal
directions (darker blue circles in
Figure~\ref{fig:simple_model}). Assuming a well stirred mixture, we
will describe nutrient dependent growth at each location using mass
action kinetics and the following reaction equation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  C + N \xrightarrow[]{r_{i}} 2C,\\
\end{equation}
where \(r_{i}\) is the rate constant of conversion at location \(i\).
As a first approach, assuming that the number of cells is continuous,
we will incorporate the effect of signal molecules on growth and the
diffusion of both nutrient and signal molecules using the following
ODEs (CANS model):
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:3}
  \begin{align}
    \frac{dC_{i}}{dt}& = r_{i}N_{i}C_{i} - \beta S_{i},\\
    \frac{dN_{i}}{dt}& = - r_{i}N_{i}C_{i} - k_{n}\sum_{j}(N_{i} - N_{j}),\\
    \frac{dS_{i}}{dt}& = \alpha C_{i} - k_{s}\sum_{j}(S_{i} - S_{j}),
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where, \(j\) indicates the closest neighbours, \(k_{n}\) and \(k_{s}\)
are nutrient and signal diffusion constants, \(\alpha\) is the rate of
secretion of signal, and \(\beta\) is a constant for the effect of
signal on culture population. Alternative models of signalling effect
could be used, depending on the mechanism of signalling under
investigation (see background section); initially, we have chosen to
use the simplest modelling approach. Setting diffusion constants to
zero reduces \ref{eq:3} to the independence model. We may also study
the effects of signalling and competition for nutrients separately by
setting other parameters to zero. If necessary, diagonal neighbours
could be incorporated into this model by adding or scaling diffusion
constants. In section~\ref{sec:dev-mod-further}, we discuss the
possibility of using finer-grain spatially-discretised or continuous
models of diffusion.
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:4}
%   \frac{dC_{i}}{dt}& = r_{i}N_{i}C_{i}(1 - \frac{S_{i}}{S_{crit}})
% \end{equation}

Models will be written in SBML (ref), using SBML shorthand (ref), so
that they may eventually be published in the BioModels database (ref)
and reused by the scientific community. This will require conformation
to the minimum information standard MIRIAM (ref). (Simulation
experiments should also conform to MIASE (ref).) We will write code
for the rest of the project in Python as this has several advantages:
it is used widely by the scientific community, has libraries which
will be of use to us, and related tools such as Colonyzer (ref) are
already written in Python. To interface SBML models with Python we
will use the libSBMLO library \citep{Bornstein2008}. ODEs will be
solved using odeint from the SciPy library \citep{SciPy}. We will use
git as version control and use GitHub as a remote repository to allow
collaboration and so that tools may eventually be released publicly.

It is anticipated that solving sets of ODEs for typically 384 cultures
in QFA and 1536 cultures in SGA will be take a long time. Therefore,
while testing, we will simulate smaller sets of artificial data from
the ODE models and attempt to fit these. We will also incorporate
unittesting into the development to try to ensure that the code will
still work when scaled up to larger arrays used in experiments.

When dealing with experimental data we must also consider how to treat
cultures around the edge of the agar. These have access to
proportionally more nutrients because there is a large area at the
edge of the plate which is unoccupied. In photographic images, these
sites are also affected by reflections from plate walls which cause
errors in intensity measurements, a proxy for cell density, which
cannot be fully corrected for by Colonyzer \citep{Lawless2010}. In
experiments, an identical culture is grown in these locations and the
results are discarded (see refs). We may choose to adjust for the
increased nutrient availability and include these sites in our model
and analysis. This would introduce a systematic error for sites close
to the plate edges and is an argument for the use of repeats and
randomisation of location (see \ref{sec:comp-exper-designs}). A
simpler modelling approach is to discard the first outer layer
entirely from the model and the second outer layer from the final
results. However, this is undesirable as it reduces the amount of
information that is gathered from each plate and may not account for
the systematic error any better that the more complicated approach,
possibly allowing it to propagate further.

\subsection{Analyse Experimental Data}
\label{sec:analyse-data}
We have access to unpublished QFA and SGA data for the model organism
\textit{S. Cerevisiae}. Some data (Figure~\ref{fig:gaps}), with vacant
gaps, is specifically designed for the study of
competition. ?presumable some with the same variants grown on the
plate?. We will analyse data from single plates to avoid having to
deal with batch variance which can be a major source of error (see
\citet{Baryshnikova2010}). We will at first fit our model to data
using least squares. The QFA R package (ref) contains functions for
fitting the independent logistic growth model and there is development
underway of a qfaBayes package (ref) which will carry out a Bayesian
inference of parameters of the same model. We plan to develop a method
for Bayesian inference using the CANS model which will account for our
prior knowledge/?belief? about parameters distributions (?any other
advantages?) (?and allow us to conduct model comparison?). In an
analysis of high-throughput QFA data from a genetic interaction study
by \citet{Addinall2011}, \citet{Heydari2016} use a Bayesian
hierarchical model which mirrors the exerimental structure (from the
time-point to population level) and simultaneously estimates growth
parameters and genetic interaction strength by sharing information
between levels. This approach accounts for differences in replicate
fitness variances between different mutant strains which cannot be
efficiently factored into statistical analyses
\citep{Heydari2016}. When looking at the most significant genetic
interactions, for the increased computational time that it takes (4
weeks vs 3 hours), this analysis does not offer a significant
advantage over an earlier statistical analysis carried out by
\citet{Addinall2011}. However, \citet{Heydari2016} do identify weakly
interacting genes for which there is no previous evidence, and a
hierarchical model which only modelled population dynamics took
significantly less time (1 week). As we are only studying single
plates and not going on to infer genetic interaction strength, there
will be fewer levels in our hierarchy, allowing for a faster
computational time, and the analysis may provide more significant
evidence in identifying competition effects than it does for genetic
interactions (?is this last bit true? ?should we discard this or
not?).

  \captionof{figure}{An agar with locations left empty (``gaps'')
    designed to exhibit effects of competition and signalling.}
  \label{fig:gaps}
\end{Figure}


If we fail to discover competition or signalling effects by fitting
the CANS model, we may need to improve aspects of our modelling
approach (see section \ref{sec:dev-mod-further}), study different
data, or consider that the data is not subject to these effects. (The
latter conclusion would raise questions about other sources of
variance.) Otherwise, if we find evidence of a significant competition
and/or signalling effect, we have proved our main hypothesis and can
move on to comparing experimental designs (section
\ref{sec:comp-exper-designs}). In order to compare diffusion across
agar height we will need to develop a two-dimensional
spatially-discretised model of diffusion (section
\ref{sec:dev-mod-further}.

We will also determine the effect of competition on different measures
of fitness discussed in section \ref{sec:genetic-interaction}. In
previous studies, which use fits of the (independent) logistic growth
model (refs), we believe that fitness estimates based on the carrying
capacity \(Z\) might be more affected by competition and signalling
than those based on the rate constant \(r\).  To asses this
possibility, an initial attempt to model competition for nutrients in
terms of parameters of the logistic growth model uses a time dependent
carrying capacity,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:5}
  Z_{i}(t) = Z_{0,i}\left(\frac{N_{0,i} + \Delta N_{i}(t)}{N_{0,i}}\right),
\end{equation}
where \(Z_{0}\) is the carrying capacity under the assumption of
independence, and is modified by the ratio of net nutrients available
at time \(t\) to the initial amount of nutrients available under the
assumption of independence \(N_{0}\). In this model, rate constants
\(r_{i}\) in \ref{eq:1} are unchanged. To fit this model to data, we
would first need to find \(\Delta N_{i}(t)\), the integral of the
second term in \ref{eq:3}b, by fitting a nutrient only version of
\ref{eq:3}. It would take further work to find exact relationships
between parameters of \ref{eq:1} and \ref{eq:3}. ?Conor, you said you
might have done this previously?  ?Also, is what I have suggested
above sensible?


\subsection{Develop Model Further}
\label{sec:dev-mod-further}
If inaccurate consider a different signal for instance. If our first
approach to modelling signal does not fit the data but we suspect that
an effect still exists we may try another simple model such as,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:6}
  \frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = r_{i}N_{i}C_{i}\left(1 - \frac{S_{i}}{S_{crit}}\right),\\
\end{equation}
where \(S_{crit}\) is some critical concentration of signal above
which cultures will not grow. We must however be careful to avoid
over-fitting by adding too much complexity to our model when we are
unsure of the underlying mechanism.

We may also model diffusion more realistically, and incorporate
interactions between diagonal neighbours, using a
spatially-discretised model of diffusion with a finer grid (see
Figure~\ref{fig:grid}). We will begin using a two-dimensional model as
this is simpler. Validating against data from miniQFA
(Figure~\ref{fig:stripes}), Figure~\ref{fig:height_dependence}
(middle) illustrates how we may remain in two-dimensions and
investigate how diffusion varies across agar height. We shall do this
for different agar geometries, varying \(d\) and \(w\) in
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_vars}. If height dependence is found to be
unimportant, we may apply a two-dimensional grid as in
Figure~\ref{fig:grid}. Otherwise, we will have to use a three
dimensional model of diffusion. It may suffice to model nutrient
diffusion in three-dimensions and signal diffusion in only
two-dimensions, as nutrients are assumed to be distributed evenly
throughout the agar at time zero, whereas signal molecules will be
secreted by cultures at the agar surface as they grow. We could also
consider using a continuous PDE model of diffusion, although this is
?likely to take more computational time? and be more difficult to
implement. Because of the generality of the problem, it is
possible that computational models of diffusion already exist
publicly, and we will explore the possibility of using them.

\subsection{Compare Experimental Designs}
\label{sec:comp-exper-designs}

If competition is present, without randomisation of culture location,
repeated observations may lead to overconfidence in fitness
estimates. As discussed in (sec), difficulties in measuring growth curves
for cultures at the agar boundaries would introduce a further
systematic error.
