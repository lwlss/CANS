\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\subsection{Develop an Initial Model}
\label{sec:initial_model}



Figure~\ref{fig:simple_model} shows a schematic of our initial approach to modelling (nutrient dependent growth with nutrient and signal diffusion).
Each culture on the agar is given a label, \(i\), and has three variables associated with it: one observed variable, \(C_{i}\), the amount of cells in the culture at location \(i\), and two hidden variables, \(N_{i}\), the amount of nutrients at location \(i\), and \(S_{i}\), the amount of signal molecule location \(i\).
Cultures in QFA and SGA agars are arranged in a square array, each culture having eight neighbours with which they could conceivably interact with directly. Initially, we will model diffusion between only the four closest neighbours, in the vertical and horizontal directions (darker blue circles in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_model}).
We will describe nutrient dependent growth at each location using mass action kinetics and the following reaction equation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  C + N \xrightarrow[]{r_{i}} 2C,\\
\end{equation}
where \(r_{i}\) is the rate constant of conversion at location \(i\).
As a first approach, assuming that the number of cells is continuous, we will incorporate the effect of signal molecules on growth and the diffusion of both nutrient and signal molecules using the following ODEs (CANS model):
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:2}
  \begin{align}
    \frac{dC_{i}}{dt}& = r_{i}N_{i}C_{i} - \beta S_{i},\\
    \frac{dN_{i}}{dt}& = - r_{i}N_{i}C_{i} - k_{n}\sum_{j}(N_{i} - N_{j}),\\
    \frac{dS_{i}}{dt}& = \alpha C_{i} - k_{s}\sum_{j}(S_{i} - S_{j}),
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where, \(j\) indicates the closest neighbours, \(k_{n}\) and \(k_{s}\) are nutrient and signal diffusion constants, \(\alpha\) is the rate of secretion of signal, and \(\beta\) is a constant for the effect of signal on culture population. Alternative models of signalling effect could be used, depending on the mechanism of signalling under investigation (see background section); initially, we have chosen to use the simplest modelling approach. Setting diffusion constants to zero reduces \ref{eq:2} to the independence model. We may also study the effects of signalling and competition for nutrients separately by setting other parameters to zero. If necessary, diagonal neighbours could be incorporated into this model by adding or scaling diffusion constants. In section~\ref{sec:dev-mod-further}, we discuss the possibility of using finer-grain spatially-discretised or continuous models of diffusion.
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:3}
%   \frac{dC_{i}}{dt}& = r_{i}N_{i}C_{i}(1 - \frac{S_{i}}{S_{crit}})
% \end{equation}

Models will be written in SBML (ref), using SBML shorthand (ref), so
that they may eventually be published in the BioModels database (ref)
and reused by the scientific community. This will require conformation
to the minimum information standard MIRIAM (ref). (Simulation
experiments should also conform to MIASE (ref).) We will write code
for the rest of the project in Python as this has several advantages:
it is used widely by the scientific community, has libraries which
will be of use to us, and related tools such as Colonyzer (ref) are
already written in Python. To interface SBML models with Python we
will use the libSBMLO library \citep{Bornstein2008}. ODEs will be
solved using odeint from the SciPy library \citep{SciPy}. We will use
git as version control and use GitHub as a remote repository to allow
collaboration and so that tools may eventually be released publicly.

It is anticipated that solving sets of ODEs for typically 384 cultures
in QFA and 1536 cultures in SGA will be take a long time. Therefore,
while testing, we will simulate smaller sets of artificial data from
the ODE models and attempt to fit these. We will also incorporate
unittesting into the development to try to ensure that the code will
still work when scaled up to larger arrays used in experiments.

\subsection{Analyse Experimental Data}
\label{sec:analyse-data}
We have access to unpublished QFA and SGA data for the model organism \textit{S. Cerevisiae}. Some data (Figure~\ref{fig:gaps}), with uncultured gaps, is specifically designed for the study of competition.

When dealing with experimental data we must also consider how to treat
cultures around the edge of the agar. These have access to
proportionally more nutrients because there is a large area at the
edge of the plate which is unoccupied. In photographic images, these
sites are also affected by reflections from plate walls which cause
errors in intensity measurements, a proxy for cell density, which
cannot be fully corrected for by Colonyzer ?\citep{Lawless2010}?. In
experiments, an identical culture is grown in these locations and the
results are discarded (see refs). We may choose to adjust for the
increased nutrient availability and include these sites in our model
and analysis. This would introduce a systematic error for sites close
to the plate edges and is an argument for the use of repeats and
randomisation of location (see \ref{sec:comp-exper-designs}). A
simpler modelling approach is to discard the first outer layer
entirely from the model and the second outer layer from the final
results. However, this is undesirable as it reduces the amount of
information that is gathered from each plate without fully removing
the systematic error.
