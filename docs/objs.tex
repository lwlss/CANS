\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
The project can be broken down into the following set of objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop models of culture growth on solid agar which account for
  competition for nutrients and signalling between cultures.
\item Analyse experimental data to determine whether competition for
  nutrients and signalling affect colony growth. If so, determine the
  size of the effect on different fitness measures.
\item Compare competition and signalling effects in different
  experimental designs in order to design experiments which minimise
  these effects. For instance, compare culture and agar geometries,
  initial culture and nutrient densities, and the effect of randomisation. Also
  look at miniQFA data to investigate the effect of diffusion across agar height.
\item Compare the reproducibility of fitness estimates between
  analyses using the competition and independence models and assess the
  likely effect on screens for genetic interactions and drug responses.
\item Continuously package SBML models and Python analysis tools so
  that they may be used in subsequent stages of the project and
  eventually by other researchers. Conform to minimum information standards so
  that SBML models may be published in the BioModels database.
\end{itemize}
